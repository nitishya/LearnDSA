DSA is so easy when you follow these 6 steps.


𝟭. 𝗙𝗼𝗰𝘂𝘀 𝗼𝗻 𝗗𝗲𝗽𝘁𝗵 𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝗕𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗱𝘁𝗵: 
 - Don't solve 500 coding problems aimlessly. Master around 100 core problems deeply instead.
 - 40 Problems on Array, Strings, LinkedList, Stack & Queue, Binary search, Trees, Graph, Sorting and Searching: https://lnkd.in/djnaPkeD
 - 40 Problems on Dynamic Programming (DP), Backtracking, Hashing, Heap, Tries, and Greedy Algorithms: https://lnkd.in/dF3h-Khk

𝟮. 𝗖𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗮 𝗹𝗶𝘀𝘁 𝗼𝗳 𝗸𝗲𝘆 𝗾𝘂𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀: 
 - Use resources like "Strivers A2Z DSA Sheet" by Raj Vikramaditya to curate around 100 core problems.

𝟯. 𝗠𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵 𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝘀𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲: 
 - Understand and implement them by hand. Know how they work internally to ace interview questions.
 - Fundamentals, Intermediate, Advance DSA topics: https://lnkd.in/d4ws9xfr

𝟰. 𝗣𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗲 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗦𝗽𝗮𝗰𝗲𝗱 𝗥𝗲𝗽𝗲𝘁𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: 
 - Revisit problems after 3 days, a week, and 15 days. Break down solutions instead of rote memorization.
